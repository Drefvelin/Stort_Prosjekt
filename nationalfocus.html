          <h2>National Focus Trees in HOI4</h2>
          <p class = "nationalfocusGrid1_E">As a country in Hearts of Iron IV you can improve your nation through various different ways. One of the main ways to do this is using the National Focus trees. Most nations only have the Generic Focus tree which gives limited possibilities. Some nations (the more important ones) have their own unique focus trees which give opportunities for expansion and other things.</p>
          <p class = "nationalfocusGrid1_E">On this page you will learn a little about how to use the focus tree powers correctly, and we will be taking examples from the Generic Focus tree. How you decide on using focus trees is comletely up to you, and it will vary from player to player based on your strategy. You do not need to follow this page completely, it is only a guide.</p>
          <p class = "nationalfocusGrid1_E">The four paths we will be taking a look at on this page is the Industrial Path, the Political Path, the Army Path and lastly the Navy and Air path. All paths have their good focuses and their "meh" focuses. Choosing the order you take focuses is essential to an efficient nation!</p>

            <p>The Continous Focus tree gives bonuses and buffs as long as this focus is active. They have no completion time, and cannot be completed. They are simply a never-ending focus that gives buffs while active. Which one of these focuses you choose depend entirely on what you want to achieve currently.</p>

            <p >The Industrial Focus path is one of the most useful focus paths of the Generic Focus tree. This path grants you a total of 7 factories(4 civ, 3 mil) and up to 2 extra research slots. You can also get a massive 4x 100% bonus for electronics which is very helpful.</p>

          <section class="nationalfocusSmallGrid">
            <p>The Political Focus path is the path you use to engage in the world politics, and choose the ideology of your nation. You have the ability to turn both fascist and communist using the path. If you go fascist you also get 7% extra manpower.</p>

          <section class="nationalfocusSmallGrid">
            <p >The Army path gives you a ton of research boosts that will hurry your tech along to either catch up, or outmatch enemy tech. You can for example use this path to get 1941 grade tanks in 1938 which will be a great help on the battlefield.</p>
            <img src="img/ArmyNF.png" alt="">
          </section>
          <section class="nationalfocusSmallGrid">
            <p >The Navy and Air Focus path, like the army path, lets you get bonuses for Navy and Air techs that give you a great advantage if used correctly. You can for example use the Air Path to get Fighter III(1944 tech) very early. This will outmatch almost any enemy plane.</p>
