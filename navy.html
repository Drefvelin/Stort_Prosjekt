          <h2>Navy in HOI4</h2>
          <p>Hearts of Iron IV spans the entire world and as we all know the world is 70% ocean. Therefore it is important for any country seeking world domination to have a fleet to wreak havoc on any enemy who dares to enter the oceans. The Navy in HOI4 has recently been updated with the DLC "Man the Guns", and this page will teach you some basics about each ship model and how to properly assemble them to be most effective.</p>

              <h2>Submarine</h2>
              <p>The Submarine is a deadly weapon to own. Easily mass produced and a deadly killer to both convoys and larger ships. Their weakness: Destroyers and Light Cruisers. To use these weapons best you need to keep visibility low, speed high, and torpedo attack high. Once you master the submarine no convoy is safe!</p>

              <h2>Heavy Cruiser</h2>
              <p>The Heavy Cruiser is the smallest capital ship in the game. It is deadly to screening ships and can pack a punch with shore bombardement. They are, however, quickly outmatched by larger capital ships such as Battlecruisers or Battleships. To make a heavy cruiser simply add at least one medium battery to the editor.</p>

              <h2>Destroyer</h2>
              <p>The Destroyer is the smallest surface ship you can build. They are cheap, easy to produce vessels that serve a variety of roles in the navy. They can be made into either convoy escorts, capital ship escorts, minelayers or minesweepers. Destroyers are absolutely neccesary to have in large numbers for any fleet to function.</p>

              <h2>Battleship</h2>
              <p>The Battleship is the juggernaut of any surface fleet. These behemoths can carry heavy armament and resist multiple hits by enemy naval guns. Smaller enemy fleets often flee upon the meer sight of such a ship! watch out though, they are vunerable to torpedoes and require escorts in the form of screening ships.</p>

              <h2>Light Cruiser</h2>
              <p>Light Cruisers serve an essential role in any navy. They are large enough to support floatplane catapults and they can carry heavier armaments than destroyers. They do this while still remaining relatively fuel-efficient. This makes the Light Cruiser essential in spotting fleets and are great escorts in strike forces.</p>

              <h2>Aircraft Carrier</h2>
              <p>The Aircraft Carrier, essentially a floating, mobile airfield. Though not neccesary in a fleet they, serve a great role in large naval battles outside the range of land-based airfields. Theaters such as the pacific are great places for these ships as they can provide full air superiority to your fleet if used correctly.</p>
