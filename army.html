          <h2>Army in HOI4</h2>
          <p>Your main force used in conquest is your land forces. These units are deployed onto the field and can be moves into armies and army groups for effective campaigns. However, to design a good division you need to know some basic things about the composition of the divisions. This page will help you design 6 useful divisions, 3 infantry divisions and 3 tank divisions.</p>

      <h1>INFANTRY DIVISIONS</h1>
      <section class="divisionGrid">
        <div class="divisionGridE">
          <h2>Classic 7x2 Infantry</h2>
          <p>If you are playing as a minor nation, having huge divisions which require metric tons of equipment and huge supply lines to function is often a bad idea. Therefore this division, commonly reffered to as the "7x2", is a very good combination of being easy on manpower and equipment while still packing a significant punch in battle. These divisions consist of 7 infantry battalions and 2 artillery batallions(hence the name 7x2). Support companies are optional.</p>

          <h2>10 Width Garrison</h2>
          <p>While in a large war you will often have to worry about enemy naval invasions or paradrops. To counter this it is important to have troops stationed in your territory to quickly fend of any invading force. You may use your normal divisions for this, however, even though they are more effective, the equipment used usually much needed elsewhere. Therefore the 10 Width garrison division, only consisting of 5 infantry battalions, is great for garrisoning your lands.</p>

        <div class="divisionGridE">
          <h2>Strong 14x4 Infantry</h2>
          <p>Do you have a large pool of manpower and a beast of a military industry? Do you want to destroy any enemy division you come in contact with? If so the 14x4 division is your go-to division. This division, essentially a doubling of the 7x2 division, is far stronger than most divisions the AI will sent at you. Therefore these are essential in breaking the enemy lines quickly. Watch out though, these divisions are large and require lots of supply! Make sure to use logistics companies with this.</p>

      <h1>ARMORED DIVISIONS</h1>
      <section class="divisionGrid">
        <div class="divisionGridE">
          <h2>Light Tank Division</h2>
          <p>You want to use tanks, but perhaps you military industry isnt the greatest, or perhaps the terrain you are fighting in is terrible. Fear not, for light tanks are the way to go! These little buggers can traverse difficult terrain far more easily than their heavier counterparts. They are also relatively cheap to produce in mass numbers. They are however, weaker than other tanks and even simple anti-tank guns may pierce the light armor these tanks have.</p>

        <div class="divisionGridE">
          <h2>Medium Tank Division</h2>
          <p>Do you want tanks with speed and firepower at the same time? Then Medium Tanks are your best bet! These tanks are fast and strong at the same time, making them a feared foe on the battlefield. They might not be able to withstand the firepower of an ememy Heavy Tank, but they are far more resistent to enemy Anti-Tank and Light Tanks. These machines however do not fare as well as the light tank in difficult terrain and they cost more to produce.</p>

        <div class="divisionGridE">
          <h2>Heavy Tank Division</h2>
          <p>Do you want to steamroll any enemy that happends to find themselves in your path? Do you have a large military industry and lots of chromium available? Are you fighting in plains or deserts? Then Heavy Tanks are the go-to tank for absolute destruction on the battlefield. The enemy will have a very hard time stopping you tanks in open terrain and they crush bunkers. Be careful though, they are competely outmatched in difficult terrain!</p>
