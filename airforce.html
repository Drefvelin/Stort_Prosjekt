          <h2>Air Force in HOI4</h2>
          <p>To support you land and sea forces it is important to take to the skies. In Hearts of Iron IV you can choose from a variety of plane models to build yourself an airforce you can use to take control of the skies and wreak havoc on the enemy, wether that is through bombing or dogfighting is up to you! This page will teach you some of the basics when using planes in HOI4.</p>

              <h2>Fighter</h2>
              <p>The Fighter is the backbone of any Air Force, their job is to protect you other aircraft and to engage enemy planes in order to take full control of the skies. These planes are small, cheap and easy to produce in numbers. Having a large amount of fighters is often one of the deciding factors in a war.</p>

              <h2>Heavy Fighter</h2>
              <p>Heavy Fighters are your average fighter, but on steroids. These double-engined aircraft have a far greater operationa range, but at the expense of being weaker in dogfighting. These planes are perfect for escorting your higly vunerable strategic or tactical bombers to their target.</p>

              <h2>Close Air Support</h2>
              <p>Close Air Support is the nightmare of any ground unit. If your fighters have taken contol of the skies these planes will hurl down at the enemy on the ground and bomb them to shreds with little to no effort. They are extremely helpful in battle, but be careful, they are easily shot down by enemy fighters or ground AA.</p>

              <h2>Tactical Bomber</h2>
              <p>Tactical Bombers are a hybrid between the behemoths known as strategic bombers, and your average CAS. Tactical Bombers can perform any air mission that CAS and Stratbombers can. This makes them a good choice for smaller economies if you just want to disrupt the enemy. These planes cannot carry nukes</p>

              <h2>Naval Bomber</h2>
              <p>Naval Bombers are essentially specialised CAS trained to target high-velocity naval targets. These bombers are very deadly to enemy ships when you have air superiority and a large force of them can single-handedly take down an enemy fleet. They are, however, vunerable to ship AA and shot down easily.</p>

              <h2>Strategic Bomber</h2>
              <p>Strategic Bombers are the heaviest plane you can produce. These planes are huge flying fortresses designed to carry their payload over vast distances with little to no escort. They have great air defense, but their agility still makes them a huge target for agile fighters. Remember to escort these planes well!</p>
